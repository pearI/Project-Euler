# Project-Euler
Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.
This repository offers solutions to the problems written in JavaScript. No actual answers are given in the source code, as to avoid spoiling it, and taking away the pleasure of solving it on your own. These are by no means the most optimal solutions, just ones I came across when I went about solving these on my own. 

Everything you need to know to get started yourself can be found on https://projecteuler.net/. This project is structured in a way where every problem has its own file, named after the id in the archive, e.g. problem 1 is named '001.js'. Although all answers are excluded from the source code, I have included a seperate text file containing them named 'answers.txt'.
